# ParallelPoker

Inspired by Jeremy Kun and his blog on the intersection between Math and Programming. https://jeremykun.com/

Failed to convert serial code to CUDA, although I think I was rather close.

I've included Jeremys OpenMP code as a reference to those who are interested.

# How to Run

make all

./poker

# Future work 

Parallelize using CUDA 

Extend the code to work for games larger than two players (I extended experiment to a three player game)

Optimize code to evaluate 5 and 7 card hands
